# Remotesensing_CH4
Combining remote sensing products from Google Earth Engine with a methane emission model to characterize surface conditions of methane hotspots in wetlands. 

This method relies on 2D spatial outputs from Camilo-Rey Sanchez's Footprint Aggregated Relative Flux Mapping model. Landsat 8 maps are then overlaid overtop to analyze the correlation between satellite spatial indices (NDVI, NDWI, Brightness Temp) and methane emissions.
